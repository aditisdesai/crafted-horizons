      <section class="card story-card">
        <h2>From building products to crafting journeys</h2>
        <p>
          For the past decade, I've led product and engineering teams—building digital experiences,
          coaching people, solving complex problems. But travel? That's always been how I really learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not the checklist kind. The kind where you sit with locals over food you can't pronounce,
          where the TV version of a place doesn't match reality, where a random conversation shifts
          how you see the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've explored 20+ destinations across continents, always researching obsessively, always
          asking "what's the story here?" Now I bring that same intentionality—the product thinking,
          the attention to detail—to designing travel experiences for others.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          Crafted Horizons is what happens when engineering discipline meets wanderlust.

          <h3>What travel has taught me</h3>
          <p>
            Every destination has a story the guidebooks miss. I'm building a collection of
            insights from 20+ countries—the food that surprised me, the cultural moments that
            didn't fit my assumptions, the places TV gets completely wrong.

          <h3>What if travel wasn't an expense?</h3>
          <p>
            Here's what I learned: you can earn while you explore. Not through influencer hype or
            digital nomad clichés—through something more tangible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I book travel for myself, family, friends. I earn commission on those bookings. I design
            trips for clients who value expertise. I also help others start their own travel businesses—people
            like you who love travel and want to align their income with their lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't passive income in the "get rich quick" sense. It's passive in the "your trips
            fund future trips" sense. It's freedom in the "you control your schedule" sense.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            Travel becomes sustainable when it pays for itself.

          <span class="pillar-number">04</span>
          <h2>Community & Opportunity</h2>
          <p class="pillar-intro">Building something together—no hype, just real growth</p>

          <h3>The opportunity</h3>
          <p>
            I'm part of <a href="https://www.thelatitudecollective.com/get-in-touch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Latitude Collective</a>—a
            community of travel advisors who've built businesses around travel. Journalists, engineers,
            educators, parents, corporate professionals. People with full-time jobs who wanted something
            more aligned with how they actually want to live.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've ever thought about earning from travel—your own bookings, helping friends, growing
            a client base—this might be worth exploring. It's not for everyone. But if you're already
            traveling, already researching, already helping people plan trips... why not get paid for it?
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring my decade of leadership experience to mentoring others in this space. The product
            thinking, the coaching, the systematic approach—it all translates.
