        <h2>From building products to crafting journeys</h2>
        <p>
          For the past decade, I've led product and engineering teams—designing digital experiences,
          coaching people, and solving complex problems. But travel has always been how I really learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not the checklist kind.
          The kind where you sit with locals over food you can't pronounce, where the TV version of a place doesn't match reality, where a single conversation shifts how you see the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've explored 20+ destinations across continents, always researching deeply, always
          asking <em>"what's the story here?"</em> Today, I bring that same intentionality—product thinking,
          attention to detail, and experience design—to planning travel for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an Independent Travel Advisor, I have access to professional travel platforms, agent-only rates,
          and trusted partners that I've already used to successfully plan and book travel for my friends and
          family. What started as something I loved doing for the people around me is now something I'm excited
          to offer more widely.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role is simple: to save you time, remove the overwhelm of planning, and help you travel with more
          confidence—using both my personal travel experience and professional access. My services cost you nothing,
          but they often make the planning process smoother, more efficient, and better informed.
