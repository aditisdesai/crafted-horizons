      <!-- What If Travel Wasn't An Expense -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>What if travel wasn't an expense?</h2>
        <p>
          Here's what I learned: you can earn while you explore. Not through influencer hype or
          digital nomad clichés—through something more tangible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I book travel for myself, family, friends. I earn commission on those bookings. I design
          trips for clients who value expertise. I also help others start their own travel businesses—people
          like you who love travel and want to align their income with their lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't passive income in the "get rich quick" sense. It's passive in the "your trips
          fund future trips" sense. It's freedom in the "you control your schedule" sense.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- How It Works -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          As an Independent Travel Advisor with InteleTravel and part of The Latitude Collective,
          I have access to professional booking systems, agent-only rates, and industry partnerships.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I book travel—for myself, for clients, for friends—I earn commission. That commission
          helps fund my own travel and gives me the flexibility to build this business on my terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same model is available to others who want to do the same. If you're already helping
          friends plan trips, already researching destinations obsessively, already thinking about
          travel constantly—why not structure that into something that pays?
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          Travel becomes sustainable when it pays for itself.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Who This Is For -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Who this is for</h2>
        <p>
          This model works for people who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Already love planning their own travel (and helping others plan theirs)</li>
          <li>Want more flexibility in how they earn income</li>
          <li>Appreciate the idea of trips funding future trips</li>
          <li>Have a network of people who trust their recommendations</li>
          <li>Want to build something aligned with how they want to live</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's a legitimate business model that requires effort,
          learning, and relationship-building. But if travel is already part of your life, it might
          be worth exploring.
        </p>

          If you're interested in learning more about building income around travel, let's have a
          conversation. No pressure, no sales pitch—just an honest discussion about whether this
          model aligns with where you're headed.
