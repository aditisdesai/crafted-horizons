      <!-- What Travel Has Taught Me -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>What travel has taught me</h2>
        <p>
          Every destination has a story the guidebooks miss. I'm building a collection of
          insights from 20+ countries—the food that surprised me, the cultural moments that
          didn't fit my assumptions, the places TV gets completely wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Travel has taught me that the best experiences are rarely the ones you plan. They're
          the conversations that happen when you're lost, the meals recommended by locals instead
          of TripAdvisor, the detours that become the highlight of your trip.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Destination Stories -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Destination stories</h2>
        <p class="small">
          <em>Coming soon: destination stories, travel insights, and the lessons I'm still learning.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm working on sharing deeper stories from my travels—what surprised me, what challenged
          my assumptions, what I'd do differently. If there's a specific destination you're curious
          about, reach out and I'll share what I learned.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Travel Philosophy -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>My travel philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I believe travel is most valuable when it pushes you beyond your comfort zone—not in an
          extreme way, but in the quiet moments where you realize your assumptions were wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          The places I remember most aren't necessarily the most beautiful or the most famous.
          They're the ones where I learned something I couldn't have learned anywhere else. Where
          a conversation shifted my perspective. Where local life looked nothing like what I'd imagined.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          That's the kind of travel I design for others—not just seeing places, but understanding them.
