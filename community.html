      <!-- The Opportunity -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>The opportunity</h2>
        <p>
          I'm part of <a href="https://www.thelatitudecollective.com/get-in-touch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Latitude Collective</a>—a
          community of travel advisors who've built businesses around travel. Journalists, engineers,
          educators, parents, corporate professionals. People with full-time jobs who wanted something
          more aligned with how they actually want to live.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've ever thought about earning from travel—your own bookings, helping friends, growing
          a client base—this might be worth exploring. It's not for everyone. But if you're already
          traveling, already researching, already helping people plan trips... why not get paid for it?
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring my decade of leadership experience to mentoring others in this space. The product
          thinking, the coaching, the systematic approach—it all translates.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- What You Get -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>What you get</h2>
        <p>
          When you join as an Independent Travel Advisor through The Latitude Collective, you gain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Professional booking platforms</strong> — access to the same systems travel agents use</li>
          <li><strong>Agent-only rates</strong> — commission structures on bookings you make</li>
          <li><strong>Training & support</strong> — onboarding, continued learning, and community</li>
          <li><strong>Mentorship</strong> — guidance from advisors (like me) who've built this successfully</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — work around your schedule, build at your pace</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is a legitimate business model, not a side hustle fad. It requires learning, relationship-building,
          and consistent effort. But for the right person, it's a way to align income with lifestyle.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Who This Is For -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Who this is for</h2>
        <p>
          This model works best for people who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Already love travel and help friends/family plan trips</li>
          <li>Want more flexibility and control over their income</li>
          <li>Are comfortable learning new systems and building relationships</li>
          <li>Have a network of people who trust their recommendations</li>
          <li>Want to build something that grows over time, not overnight</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If that resonates, let's have a conversation. I'll share how I got started, what the learning
          curve looks like, and whether this aligns with what you're looking for.
        </p>

      <!-- My Approach to Mentoring -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>My approach to mentoring</h2>
        <p>
          I spent a decade leading product and engineering teams—coaching people, breaking down complex
          problems, helping others build their skills systematically. That's how I approach mentoring
          in this space.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not here to sell you on hype. I'm here to give you honest guidance about what works,
          what doesn't, and how to build this in a way that fits your life.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          If you're curious, let's talk. No pressure, no sales pitch—just a real conversation about
          whether this opportunity makes sense for you.
