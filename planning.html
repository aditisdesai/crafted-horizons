        <div class="card">
          <h2>How I help</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom itineraries shaped by your interests (not a template)</li>
            <li>Research-driven recommendations from someone who's actually been there</li>
            <li>Family trips, milestone celebrations, group adventures</li>
            <li>Cruises & all-inclusive options (with honest tradeoffs)</li>
            <li>Support before, during, and after—like having a travel partner on call</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As an Independent Travel Advisor, I have access to professional travel platforms,
            agent-only rates, and trusted partners that I've used to successfully plan trips for
            friends and family. Now I'm offering that same service more widely.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>The process</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>You share your vision</strong> — dates, budget, travel style, what matters to you</li>
            <li><strong>I research & curate</strong> — options aligned to your preferences, not commission</li>
            <li><strong>You book with confidence</strong> — and I stay with you through the journey</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="small">
            The more detail you share upfront, the faster I can tailor recommendations that actually fit.

      <!-- Why Work With Me -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Why work with me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not selling you a package. I'm not working off commission incentives. I'm using the
          same research approach I use for my own travel—obsessive attention to detail, understanding
          the story behind a place, and designing an experience that fits how you actually want to travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          My services cost you nothing extra. I earn through industry partnerships and agent rates,
          but my recommendations are driven by what makes sense for your trip—not what earns me more.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          Think of it as having a travel partner who's done the homework, has professional access,
          and cares about getting it right.
